# CSS Float Layout Bug with Undefined Div Heights

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using CSS floats without specifying the height of the floated elements.  The problem manifests when the content height of the divs is inconsistent or unknown.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when using the `float` property on `div` elements without defining a height.  In some browsers (especially older versions), this can lead to rendering issues such as incorrect layout, overlapping elements, or unpredictable positioning.

## Solution

The solution addresses this issue by utilizing several different approaches to resolve the undefined height issue, ensuring consistent and predictable layout regardless of the content height within the floated `div` elements.  These approaches involve:

1. **Explicit Height:** Setting a fixed height on the div elements.
2. **Overflow:** Setting the `overflow` property to ensure that the content does not influence the element's dimensions.
3. **Clearing Floats:** Using a clearfix technique to properly clear the floats and prevent the parent container from collapsing.
