The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when the `div` elements do not have a defined height.  In some cases, the elements will not render correctly, or their position might be unpredictable. This is particularly true when the content within the `div` elements varies in height.
